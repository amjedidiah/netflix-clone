### About Me

I am Jedidiah Amaraegbu.

I am proficient in developing, testing, debugging, integrating and maintaining accessible web applications and APIs. My focus is on producing quality code that is readable, maintainable, secure, and scalable.

I have a strong background in web development, having started learning about it in school, as far back as 2015. However, I battled with imposter syndrome and how to combine it with my studies for a long time, until around 2019, when I won the bronze and gold medals at the Regional and National iCreate Skills festival.

Since then, I have continued to expand my skills and knowledge by tutoring web development in 3 African countries with Andela and Go My Code. I also enjoy sharing my expertise by speaking at tech events.
In addition to my technical abilities, I enjoy meeting and interacting with new people.

Currently, I am a Software Engineer at Remotebase, where I contribute my skills and experience to some of the best companies in Silicon Valley.
